## Scoring Methodology

Our analysis evaluates candidates across 5 key dimensions using a weighted scoring system:

### Category Weights:
1. **Skills Match** (35%) - Technical skills, technologies, and tools
2. **Experience Alignment** (25%) - Years of experience, relevant roles, and industry background
3. **Education & Certifications** (20%) - Degrees, certifications, and formal qualifications
4. **Achievements & Outcomes** (10%) - Measurable accomplishments and project outcomes
5. **Soft Skills & Culture** (10%) - Communication, leadership, teamwork, and cultural fit

### Fit Classification Thresholds:
- **GOOD_FIT**: Overall Score â‰¥ 80/100
  - Candidate meets or exceeds most requirements
  - Strong alignment across multiple dimensions
  - Ready to excel in the role with minimal onboarding

- **PARTIAL_FIT**: Overall Score 60-79/100
  - Candidate meets many core requirements
  - Some gaps in skills or experience
  - Could succeed with additional training or support

- **NOT_FIT**: Overall Score < 60/100
  - Significant gaps in critical requirements
  - Limited alignment with role expectations
  - Would require substantial development

## Overall Assessment:
- **Composite Score**: {overall_score:.1f}/100
- **Fit Classification**: **{fit_classification}**

## Your Task:

Generate a comprehensive, personalized **fit rationale** (300-500 words) that explains WHY this candidate is classified as a **{fit_classification}** for this role.

Your rationale should:

1. **Opening Statement**: Start with a clear verdict on the candidate's fit level

2. **Strengths Analysis** (150-200 words):
   - Identify 2-3 strongest areas based on the scores above
   - Cite specific skills, experiences, or achievements from the data
   - Explain HOW these strengths align with job requirements
   - Use concrete examples (e.g., "The candidate's 5 years of Python experience directly matches the required backend development expertise")

3. **Gap Analysis** (100-150 words):
   - Identify the most critical gaps or weaknesses
   - Prioritize gaps by importance to the role
   - Be specific about what's missing (e.g., "Missing AWS and Kubernetes skills required for cloud infrastructure management")
   - For GOOD_FIT: Focus on minor improvements or growth areas
   - For PARTIAL_FIT: Focus on trainable gaps and development opportunities
   - For NOT_FIT: Focus on fundamental mismatches

4. **Contextual Insights** (50-100 words):
   - Consider the overall narrative (e.g., "While the candidate lacks direct experience, their strong foundation in X suggests quick adaptability")
   - Mention compensating factors if relevant (e.g., "Certifications compensate for shorter experience")
   - Address career trajectory or growth potential

5. **Closing Recommendation**:
   - GOOD_FIT: "Strong recommend for interview" + 1 area to probe
   - PARTIAL_FIT: "Conditional recommend" + specific conditions/support needed
   - NOT_FIT: "Not recommended unless X changes" + alternative role suggestions if possible

## Important Guidelines:
- Be specific and data-driven, not generic
- Maintain professional yet empathetic tone
- Balance honesty with encouragement
- Focus on the top 2-3 factors that most influenced the classification
- Avoid repeating the numerical scores (they're already visible)
- Write for hiring managers who will use this to make decisions
